= FOR EVERY ECOMMERCE STORE OWNER =

It works for all types of eCommerce store owners with different shipment volumes - from dropshippers who ship several parcels a month to sellers with thousands of parcels and multiple suppliers.

TrackMage supports 597 carriers and tracks your parcels (inbound and outbound) from the US, Europe, Asia and literally all shipping companies in the world.

It handles multi-store setup, and you can have a separate workspace for each store, each warehouse and everything else to directly match your organizational structure.

TrackMage Tracking Page will help you inform your customers about the status of their order. They will have access to the tracking information at all times. This reduces the frequency of complaints, refunds, and disputes.

TrackMage also offers pre-configured email notifications for all the typical shipment statuses and related events.

With TrackMage you can analyze your carrierâ€™s performance across all channels and use that data to cut the costs.
